# wtXPD-ssDNA
The 3.5 Âµs MD simulation trajectories for XPD-unmod, and XPD-lesionOUT, and XPD-lesionIN are
deposited on GitHub (https://github.com/broydelab/wtXPD-ssDNA). 
For each system, the trajectory files are presented in binary NETCDF format(*.nc), 
a corresponding topology PRMTOP file (*.top) and PDB file with the coordinates of the initial structure (*.pdb)
are also provided. 

Please note that water molecules and ions are not included in all files. 
Please note that the trajectories were saved every 10 ns.
