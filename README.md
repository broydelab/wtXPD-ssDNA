## wtXPD-ssDNA
The 3.5 µs MD simulation trajectories for XPD-unmod, and XPD-lesionOUT, and XPD-lesionIN are
deposited on GitHub (https://github.com/broydelab/wtXPD-ssDNA). 

## Files included:
For each system, the trajectory files are presented in binary NETCDF format, *1.nc and *2.nc; 
a corresponding topology PRMTOP files, *.top, and the coordinates of the initial structure in PDB files, *.pdb
are also provided. * = XPD-unmod, XPD-lesionOUT, XPD-lesionIN

## Note 
* Water molecules and ions are not included in all files. 
* The trajectories were saved every 10 ns; trajectories between 0 to 1.8 µs are saved in *1.nc and 
between 1.8 to 3.5 µs are saved in *2.nc for each system. 
* DNA lesion studied is the mutagenic pyrimidine (6−4) pyrimidone UV photoproduct (6−4PP lesion).
